    explanation:
      'A modulating valve is a control handle on the dashboard that is used to apply the spring brakes gradually. It is spring-loaded so you have a feel for the braking action. The more you move the control lever, the harder the spring brakes come on. They work this way so you can control the spring brakes if the service brakes fail.'

    },
    answer: 'b',
    explanation:
      'Dual parking control valves are found on some vehicles, such as buses, and have a separate air tank which can be used to release the spring brakes. When main air pressure is lost, the spring brakes come on. One of the valves is a push-pull type and is used to put on the spring brakes for parking. The other valve is spring loaded in the "out" position. When you push the control in, air from the separate air tank releases the spring brakes so you can move. When you release the button, the spring brakes come on again.'

      d: 'To provide additional stopping power'
    },
    answer: 'b',
    explanation:
      'Spring brakes are usually used as emergency and parking brakes in trucks, truck tractors, and buses. They are held on by mechanical force and are applied when air pressure is removed. A parking brake control in the cab allows the driver to let the air out of the spring brakes. This lets the springs put the brakes on. A leak in the air brake system, which causes all the air to be lost, will also cause the springs to put on the brakes.'

      d: 'The steering wheel will vibrate'
    },
    answer: 'a',
    explanation:
      'A low air pressure warning signal is required on vehicles with air brakes. A warning signal you can see must come on before the air pressure in the tanks falls below 60 psi. (Or one half the compressor governor cutout pressure on older vehicles.) The warning is usually a red light.'

      d: 'The brake pedal is connected to the brake calipers which squeeze the brake pads against the brake rotor or disc'
    },
    answer: 'b',
    explanation:
      'When air is let into each brake chamber, it moves the slack adjuster, thus twisting the brake camshaft. This turns the s-cam, which forces the brake shoes away from one another and presses them against the inside of the brake drum. When the brake pedal is released, the s-cam rotates back and a spring pulls the brake shoes away from the drum, letting the wheels roll freely again.'

    },
    answer: 'c',
    explanation:
      'In air-operated disc brakes, air pressure acts on a brake chamber and slack adjuster, like s-cam brakes. But instead of the s-cam, a "power screw" is used. The pressure of the brake chamber on the slack adjuster turns the power screw. The power screw clamps the disc or rotor between the brake lining pads of a caliper, similar to a large c-clamp.'

    answer: 'a',
    explanation:
      'Check Slack Adjusters on S-cam Brakes. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that you can reach. If a slack adjuster moves more than about one inch where the push rod attaches to it, it probably needs adjustment. Adjust it or have it adjusted. Vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop.'

    text: 'The purpose of the low air pressure warning signal in air brakes is ____',
    options: {
      a: 'To indicate when the brakes need to be adjusted',
      b: 'To indicate when the air pressure is low',
      c: 'To indicate when the engine is off',
      d: 'To indicate when the brakes are overheating'
    },
    answer: 'b',
    explanation:
      "The low air pressure warning signal must come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank (or tank with the lowest air pressure, in dual air systems). If the warning signal doesn't work, you could lose air pressure and you would not know it. This could cause sudden emergency braking in a single-circuit air system."

    text: 'The purpose of a dual air brake system is _____',
    options: {
      a: 'To have two different types of brakes on a vehicle',
      b: 'To increase the stopping distance of a vehicle',
      c: 'For safety in case one system fails',
      d: 'To reduce the amount of air needed to stop the vehicle'
    },
    answer: 'c',
    explanation: 'Most heavy-duty vehicles use dual air brake systems for safety. A dual air brake system has two separate air brake systems, which use a single set of brake controls.'

    answer: 'b',
    explanation: 'During Step 2 Engine Compartment Checks, you should check the air compressor drive belt if the compressor is belt-driven. It should be in good condition and tightened properly.'

    options: {
      a: 'Check them with your bare hands',

      c: 'Use a wrench to turn them',

    answer: 'b',
    explanation: 'During Step 5 Walk-Around Inspection, you should check the slack adjusters on S-cam brakes. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that you can reach. If a slack adjuster moves more than about one inch where the push rod attaches to it, it probably needs adjustment.'

    options: {
      a: 'Increase your speed to maintain pressure',

      c: 'Continue driving and hope for the best',
      d: 'Pump the brakes to maintain pressure'

    answer: 'b',
    explanation: 'If the air pressure in the air system drops too low during driving, you should stop and fix the problem before driving again. Otherwise, you could lose your brakes while driving.'

    title: 'What should you test when testing the service brakes?',
    options: {
      a: 'Test the brakes by pressing the pedal as hard as possible',
      b: 'Test the brakes by driving at high speeds and then stopping quickly',
      c: 'Test the brakes by applying them firmly at about five mph',
      d: 'To improve fuel efficiency'
    },
    answer: 'c',
    explanation:
      'When testing the service brakes, you should wait for normal air pressure, release the parking brake, move the vehicle forward slowly (about five mph), and apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action. This test may show you problems, which you otherwise wouldn\'t know about until you needed the brakes on the road.'
